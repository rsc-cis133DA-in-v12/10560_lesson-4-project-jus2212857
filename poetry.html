        <h2>
            IT'S HOT!
        </h2>
        <p>
            by Shel Silverstein
        </p>
        <p>
            It's hot!<br>
I can't get cool.<br>
I've drunk a quart of lemonade.<br>
I think I'll take my shoes off<br>
And sit around in the shade.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's hot!<br>
My back is sticky.<br>
The sweat rolls down my chin.<br>
I think I'll take my clothes off<br>
And sit around in my skin.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's hot!<br>
I've tried with 'lectric fans.<br>
And pools and ice cream cones.<br>
I think I'll take my skin off<br>
And sit around in my bones.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>It's still hot!</em>
            <!-- This line is important because it reiterates the title. After everything that was done to alleviate the issue of being hot, it's still hot.  -->
